# Connect 4 Game implemented in ReactJS (Webpack and Babel)

Connect Four is a two-person strategy game with the goal of bringing the first four of his own pieces in a line.

__Webpack__ - A module bundler (we use it also as task runner, so we didn't implement `grunt` or `gulp`)
__Babel__ - A Javascript compiler  
__ES6__ - A relatively new Javascript standard  
__Yarn__ - A package manager  
__React__ - As expected  

### Pre-requirements
- brew & node & yarn
- brew update
- brew install yarn

### To get started
1. `cd` into your project directory
2. run `bundle install`
3. run `yarn install`
4. run `yarn start`
5. now the game is available on `localhost:4444`

### External Sources
- __Redux__: A state management tool to handle the different game states (e.g. starting and stopping game, initialize default settings, save user defined settings like number or rows or cols or player names, update board after move, ...)
- __Countdown__ (`react-countdown-now`): A external react plugin to set and handle countdown timer
